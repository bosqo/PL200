4. **Review Key Concepts**
   - Light review of main topics (don't cram new material)
   - Review the exam objectives one more time

### During the Exam

1. **Read Questions Carefully**
   - Pay attention to keywords like "EXCEPT," "NOT," "least privilege," "minimum permissions"
   - Underline key requirements in your mind
   - Don't rush through the question reading

2. **Manage Your Time**
   - Aim for 2-3 minutes per question maximum
   - Don't spend too long on one question
   - Mark difficult questions for review if time allows
   - For 40-60 questions in 120 minutes: ~2 minutes per question

3. **Answer Strategy**
   - Answer questions you know first to build confidence
   - For multiple choice: Eliminate obviously wrong answers
   - For case studies: Read the scenario once, then answer all related questions
   - Watch for version numbers (classic workflows vs cloud flows, CDS vs Dataverse)

4. **Use Process of Elimination**
   - Remove answers that contradict each other
   - Watch for "trick" answers that are partially correct
   - Remember Microsoft recommends modern solutions (cloud flows over classic workflows)

5. **Answer All Questions**
   - Don't leave questions blank
   - Even a guess is better than no answer
   - You can review marked questions if time permits

### Common Exam Question Keywords

Watch for these terms that change question meaning:

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **EXCEPT** | All options are correct EXCEPT... |
| **NOT** | This is not the correct answer |
| **Least privilege** | Minimum permissions needed |
| **Best practice** | Recommended approach |
| **Must** | Required, non-negotiable |
| **Should** | Recommended, best practice |
| **Can** | Possible, not necessarily best |
| **All of the above** | Multiple answers are correct |
| **None of the above** | All options are incorrect |

### Things to Remember

1. **Version Matters**
   - Classic Workflows are deprecated → Use Cloud Flows
   - CDS (Common Data Service) is now called Dataverse
   - Update your knowledge to current terminology

2. **Security Questions**
   - "Least privilege" means minimum permissions needed
   - Understand privilege levels: None, User, Business Unit, Organization
   - Know the difference between role-based and record-based security

3. **Architecture Questions**
   - Focus on the "why" not just "how"
   - Understand business requirements first
   - Think about scalability and maintainability

4. **Multiple Answer Questions**
   - Read all options before deciding
   - "Select all that apply" requires identifying ALL correct answers
   - Partially correct is not correct
